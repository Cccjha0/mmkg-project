# Inference Module

This module turns training artifacts into stable Python inference entry points.
It currently supports checkpoint loading, tail prediction, attribute completion,
multimodal entity inspection, similar-entity retrieval, demo scripts, and basic latency benchmarking.

## Current Status

Implemented:

- runtime loader: [runtime.py](/E:/learn/R&D/mmkg-project/ml/inference/runtime.py)
- predictor interface: [predictor.py](/E:/learn/R&D/mmkg-project/ml/inference/predictor.py)
- shared parsing/formatting helpers: [utils.py](/E:/learn/R&D/mmkg-project/ml/inference/utils.py)
- CLI inference entry: [run_predict.py](/E:/learn/R&D/mmkg-project/ml/inference/scripts/run_predict.py)
- demo script: [demo_openbg_img.py](/E:/learn/R&D/mmkg-project/ml/inference/scripts/demo_openbg_img.py)
- latency benchmark script: [benchmark_inference.py](/E:/learn/R&D/mmkg-project/ml/inference/scripts/benchmark_inference.py)

Supported tasks:

1. Given `(head, relation)`, predict top-k tails.
2. Given an entity, complete attributes over configured attribute relations.
3. Given an entity, inspect multimodal availability and embedding summaries.
4. Given an entity, retrieve similar entities in a chosen representation space.

## Runtime Contract

### Inputs

- Internal inputs use integer ids.
- External inputs accept `ent_XXXXXX` and `rel_XXXX`.
- Legacy run directories are supported. Old config paths such as `cache/...` and `datasets/...` are rewritten to `data/cache/...` and `data/datasets/...` at runtime.

### Outputs

All public predictor methods now return the same top-level structure:

```json
{
  "task": "tail",
  "model": "openbg_img_gated",
  "device": "cpu",
  "inputs": {},
  "results": [],
  "latency_ms": 123.4
}
```

Stable top-level fields:

- `task`
- `model`
- `device`
- `inputs`
- `results`
- `latency_ms` when timing is available

Task names currently used:

- `tail`
- `tail_batch`
- `attr`
- `entity`
- `similar`

## Text and Metadata Resolution

The inference layer automatically loads:

- `*_entity2text.tsv`
- `*_relation2text.tsv`

based on the configured training dataset path.

Entity formatting uses zero-padded tokens:

- entities: `ent_007314`
- relations: `rel_0096`

This is required for consistent lookup into dataset text maps.

## Attribute Completion

`attr` is implemented as repeated tail prediction over a relation set.

Priority order for attribute relation selection:

1. `inference.attribute_relations` in config
2. automatic fallback: top frequent relations from training data

Current OpenBG-IMG experiment configs already include explicit `attribute_relations`.

## Multimodal Entity View

`get_entity_multimodal()` currently returns:

- entity id and token
- entity text
- text/image embedding availability
- whether an image exists
- inferred `image_path` when available
- available representation spaces
- per-space embedding summary
- fused summary when available
- gate summary when available

## Similar Entity Query

Supported spaces:

- `text`
- `image`
- `fused`
- `entity_repr`

Current implementation uses exact retrieval, chunked over all entities.
Approximate indexing is not implemented yet.

## Scripts

## CPU Baseline

Measured on March 12, 2026 with:

- model: `openbg_img_gated`
- run dir: `ml/artifacts/outputs/openbg_img_gated_vec_res_rel/20260308_123356_seed1`
- device: `cpu`
- entity: `ent_007314`
- relation: `rel_0096`
- topk: `5`
- repeats: `2`

Observed mean latency:

- `tail`: about `272 ms`
- `tail_batch` with 2 queries: about `552 ms`
- `attr`: about `1375 ms`
- `entity`: about `5.5 ms`
- `similar`: about `130 ms`

Practical interpretation:

- `entity` and `similar` are already cheap enough for normal synchronous API usage.
- `tail` is acceptable for synchronous usage on CPU.
- `attr` is noticeably slower because it runs multiple tail queries serially.
- `tail_batch` is currently just repeated single-query execution, not a fused batch scorer.

## Current Limitations

- benchmark results are currently documented only for CPU
- text output still shows terminal-encoding issues in the current shell on some Chinese strings
- `tail_batch` is structurally standardized but not computationally optimized
- attribute completion still depends on a manually curated relation list for best quality
- no backend API layer has been added yet
- no ANN index or retrieval cache has been added for large-scale similarity search

## Next Tasks

Recommended next steps:

1. optimize `tail_batch` into a true batched scorer instead of repeated single-query calls
2. measure GPU latency baselines for the same tasks
3. add a thin backend wrapper around the predictor contract
4. fix terminal and API text-encoding presentation end-to-end
5. optionally add approximate retrieval for `similar`
